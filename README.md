# Airports
The Airports Project takes a dot file that contains a list of connecting flights and their corresponding total miles and determines the shortest path by using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm provides users with the ability to optimize travel paths based on distance. Users are presented with a user-friendly interface that offers options to explore statistics related to the file or input a flight path. Upon input, users receive information about the shortest route such as its total miles. Overall, the project offers a seamless interaction for users to input and update data, perform statistical analyses, and find optimal travel paths.
